# What to read?

This repository builds a MongoDB database and a prototype front-end which is used in the [What to read?](https://www.shawnchahal.com/what-to-read) web app.

## What does the app do?

[What to read?](https://www.shawnchahal.com/what-to-read) is a web app where the user rates books and gets recommendations. The app employs collaborative filtering in Python on user ratings from the [Book-Crossing Dataset](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/) stored in a MongoDB database.
